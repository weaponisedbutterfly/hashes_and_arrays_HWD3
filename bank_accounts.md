# Bank: Functions, Array, Hashes, Loops Exercise
###Mo Money Mo Problems

Now that you're programmers the instructors at CodeClan would like you to set up a bank so that we can make lots of money from you.

We have created a runner file bank_accounts_runner.rb, with the functionality we would like our bank to have. 

It is your task to create these functions in the bank_accounts_functions.rb file to provide this functionality. This file currently has access to the data,  but not the functionality.

New Ruby Grammer! We have declared the data as a constant here. A constant like a variable give us a reference to an object. Constant are declared in all capitals.  There are two main differences. Constants shouldn't be changed, Ruby will warn us if we try to do this.  And constant is accesible throughout all the functions. This is handy for us so all our functions can access the data

The format follows what we have been doing in class.  Uncommentating the desired behaviour one by one and writing the require functionality.  For the first few behaviours the desired behaviour is defined explicitly.  For the later behaviours you will need to define what you would like to happen yourself.


run file using

```
  #terminal(not irb)
  ruby bank_accounts_runner.rb
```
[:note] The first function has been written for you

[:note] Try and follow the test driven development methodology. Uncomment the desired behaviour you are working on.  Run the runner to generate the error,  then write the functionality to make the test past.
